                                First, I want to talk about the thing that inspired me to IT is gaming. From the first time I came into the game I was very charismatic, and I have always wanted to be a game programmer. IT has many things that fascinate me, and I always think that the technology of IT can change the future in a more disruptive way. The technological innovation I want to see the most sounds a bit weird, but I have always wanted a mind-reading shopping cart. It will make shopping become much more convenient. Although I really like games, I have another passion for the car. I love super cars and have always dreamed of owning it one day and my goal is to become a Senior IT Executive at Porsche. However, this job requires me to have at least 3 years of experience working in the same position at a multinational company which mean project to have experience in car industry, Microsoft Dynamic Navision, SAP and IT market will help me a lot.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                                Secondly, about my project idea I have thought of an app to make it easier for people to buy cars. because the number of people want to have a car is increasing and normal payment takes a lot of time. The effects of the COVID-19 epidemic had a strong blow to the Vietnamese car market when first quarter sales plunged with a decrease of more than 30% compared to the same period in 2019. Entering the second quarter, in second quarter the scene of businesses having to launch promotions and discounts to recover, the market suddenly received the first hit of the Covid-19 epidemic. As a result, April sales of most automakers "fall free". Sales of cars decreased by nearly 50% compared to the same period in 2019. The optimism only started to appear again when the official social gap order was lifted. Car market in May 2020 seemed to increase strongly. Purchasing power increased sharply by 62% compared to the previous month. Through June, the positive numbers continued to be maintained with an increase of 26%. Although heavily influenced by the COVID-19, we can see that if everything is stable, the car industry in Vietnam will thrive again immediately. Then a software used to buy a car online will be an optimal choice right now, especially when the translation COVID-19 has not ended.                            </p>
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                                Thirdly, this app will have features such as car orders from other manufacturers not available in the country, buying and selling genuine cars, buying and selling used cars, ... And of course, there will be many different payment options such as hire purschase, cash payments, online transfers, ... As far as I know, there are a lot of people who like super car brands like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Audi, ... but there are models that are not available in Vietnam. People must order and wait a long time for the car to come but encounter complicated paperwork and they cannot experience the car before they choose it, and it is also difficult to find a reputable place to order. With an online car buying and selling app, everything will become simpler for many customers, just choose a car and choose a payment method to be able to own a car and all paperwork will be done by app operator. The app will also have VR functionality so that users can experience the car in the most authentic way. All information about the vehicle that customers want such as warranty policy or customer care regime will be fully displayed in the explanation section. In addition, the app also has the feature to call the car repairman if your car is accidentally damaged and you cannot find a repair site with just one button, someone will come to assist you immediately.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                                 Creating an app is very difficult and as far as I can research, I need to use programming languages like Java, C ++, C #, ... this has a lot of things to learn. I think I will use PyCharm, Atom and Visual Studio Code to create the app. PyCharm is a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Jet Brains and specifically designed for Python. PyCharm is available on all 3 platforms Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Atom is open-source software for text editing. Atom is quite similar to other software such as notepad ++, sublime text ... it supports plugins to program languages such as Node.js, C / C ++, java. Visual Studio Code (VS Code or VSC) is one of the most popular source code editors used by programmers. Fast, light, multi-platform support, many features and being open source are the outstanding advantages that make VS Code increasingly widely used.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
                                 If this project is successful, all car buying problems will be completely solved. This could cause a sharp increase in vehicle sales, even breaking the record of selling more than 400,000 cars to customers in 2019 and this will help businesses reach more customers. Even when there is a pandemic in the world like COVID-19, people can safely buy a car without fear of infection.
